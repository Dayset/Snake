# Snake Classic Game (C#, console)

**Important !**  
To properly launch Snake Classic Game as windows console application, you should set **Raster fonts** in console properties.  
Otherwise app will throw an exception and will not work. Look for square font, if you don't have such, pick 8x9.

Unfortunately windows console is very limited, and there is no 'civilized' way to set font from application.  
Otherwise without square like fonts text-ASCII graphics will look very ugly.
